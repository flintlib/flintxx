# FLINTXX (maintenance only)
## C++ interface to [FLINT](https://github.com/flintlib/flint) (Fast Library for Number Theory)

## Overview
FLINT provides fast algorithms for number theoretic computations. For many
reasons, it is written in C. Nonetheless, some users prefer object oriented
syntax. FLINTXX is a set of wrapper C++ classes, together termed flintxx,
which provide such an object oriented syntax.
In general, flintxx strives to behave just like the underlying FLINT C, see the documentation for some exceptions.
